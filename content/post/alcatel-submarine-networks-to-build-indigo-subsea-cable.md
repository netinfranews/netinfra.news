AARNet, Google, Indosat Ooredoo, Singtel, SubPartners, and Telstra have entered into an agreement with Alcatel Submarine Networks (ASN) to build the new Indigo subsea cable system.

Once completed, the Indigo cable system (previously known as APX West & Central) will strengthen links between Australia and the South East Asian markets.

The Indigo cable system will span approximately 9,000 km and connect Singapore and Perth, and onwards to Sydney.

Landing in existing facilities in Singapore, Australia and Indonesia, the system will also allow connections between Singapore and Jakarta.

The system will use a two-fibre pair ‘open cable’ design with spectrum- sharing technology.

Using coherent optical technology, which uses light to transmit data along fibre optic cables, each of the two-fibre pairs will have a minimum capacity of 18 terabits per second, with the option to increase this capacity in the future.

ASN will construct the cable, which is expected to be completed by mid-2019.
